## My learning

- tried to use dotenv in react js project..it wont work because 
  When working with React, environment variables are variables that are available through a global process.env Object. That global Object is provided by your environment through NodeJs. And because we don’t have NodeJs in the browser, we’re going to need webpack.
- in api/index.js arrow functions can be used instead of normal functions
- learnt how to use async and await in useEffect
- learnt why promises was getting returned due to not using await in useEffect
- learnt how to properly destructure..basically we shd now where is present in object
  so that we can properly destructure
- learnt to handle props if they are empty
